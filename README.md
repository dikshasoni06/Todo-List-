# React + Vite

I've developed a responsive ToDo list website using React.js, ensuring it can seamlessly adapt to various devices for optimal user experience. The website allows users to efficiently manage tasks across different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones alike

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
